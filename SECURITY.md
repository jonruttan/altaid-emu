# Security Policy

This is an emulator and not a network service, but security bugs still matter.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately to the maintainer (do not open a public issue).
Include:

- a short description
- reproduction steps (commands, ROM used, OS)
- expected vs actual behavior

## Supported versions

Only the `main` branch and the latest release are supported.
